# SAT - Project

In this project, I want to grapple with the satisfiability problem (SAT).

I want to

- have proper encodings of SAT-instances
- parse & write instances to files
- be able to extract the core of a SAT-instance
- detect polynomially solvable SAT-instances (as e.g. horn-clauses)
- implement known algorithms for SAT
- run those algorithms against sample instances and measure their performance
- get a feeling for what instance sizes are possible to deal with
- try to do some research on my own: is it possible to find characteristics of (un)satisfiable instances?

## Literature

- Das Erfüllbarkeitsproblem SAT (Uwe Schöning, [siehe hier](https://www.google.de/books/edition/Das_Erf%C3%BCllbarkeitsproblem_SAT/55HzCQAAQBAJ?hl=de&gbpv=0))
