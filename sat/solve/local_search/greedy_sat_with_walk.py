    Determines satisfiability using WalkSAT â€” a variant of GSAT with probabilistic walks.

    At each step:
      - With probability `p`, randomly flip a variable from an unsatisfied clause.
      - With probability `1 - p`, flip the variable that most increases satisfied clauses (GSAT strategy).

    This hybrid strategy helps avoid local optima by introducing random exploration.
