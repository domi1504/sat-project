    Determine whether an instance satisfies Tovey's criterion for satisfiability.

    Tovey's criterion states that a CNF formula is satisfiable if:
        - Every clause contains at least k literals, and
        - No variable appears (positively or negatively) in more than k clauses,
          where k is the size of the smallest clause.
